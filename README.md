## Dataset

> 
This Dataset contains the records of 15198 loans listings with lot of releted variables including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower state, and many others.
This Data can be used to make lot of informed decisions and also finding interesting insights.
The dictionary and dataset can be found  [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1581581520570000&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1667853064066678&usg=AOvVaw2ZTL0VaTdibiaWT8cCoybu)
 I won't be exploring all the variables but I picked few catagorical and Quantitative variables to find the insights and the individual contribution of each variable to the BorroweRate.

## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.
Based on the visualizations founf through exploration, the key takeaway is that some variables that can be thought as the contributors to some dependent variables can turn out to be otherwise. So for better results and insights it is important to use more variables and dig more on the relationships and contributions they posses. None of the choosen variables seemed to positevely correlate with the variable of interest. I believe this Exploration can be improved by putting more effort in data wrangling and feture selection.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Select one or two main threads from your exploration to polish up for your presentation. Note any changes in design from your exploration step here.
  -As the prosperscore increases the Borrower Rate decreases and that make a little bit of sense,because these are people who are in good postion according to Prosper ,hence they posses lower risk so  they will have lower interest rate than those who are rated lower.
  -According to the exploration of the data,the largest interest rate listed is found on the people who identified themselves as not the the home owners. This might also be associated with risky and not risky clients, because owning a home may serve as an evidence being responsible financially hence there is a lower risk. This can be confirmed or explored further as this is still the assumption.
